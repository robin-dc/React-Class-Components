## 📍 Why Learn React Class Components?

React Class Components remains valuable even today, despite the growing popularity of React Hooks. Many existing projects and codebases still use class components, making it essential for developers to understand and work with them. Additionally, certain libraries and third-party components may still be built using class components, and being familiar with them allows developers to integrate these components seamlessly into their applications. This knowledge can be helpful when maintaining or debugging legacy projects that heavily rely on class components. React Class Components ensures developers are well-rounded and equipped to work effectively across a wide range of React codebases and scenarios.
